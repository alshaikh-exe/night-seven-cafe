# Night Seven Café 🌙  
*"In a fading world, a small café stays open. You keep it alive."*

**Night Seven Café** is a pixel-art, narrative-driven drink-making game where you run a quiet café that serves both the living and the haunted. Over seven nights, you interact with moody, emotionally complex customers with some feeling joyful, some feeling broken and you must match handcrafted drinks to their hidden feelings.

Gameplay is a blend of emotional storytelling, drink-matching, and dice-based stat modifiers that affect your every night.

## How to Play 🎮 
**Welcome to the quiet hours of midnight.**  
Each night, a handful of strangers wander into your haunted little café. Your job? Read between the lines, listen with care, and serve them a drink that speaks to their soul.  
But beware, for on certain nights, the ghosts who arrive aren’t here for drinks... they're here for answers. And they all remember what you did.

### Gameplay Modifiers: The Three Dice 🎲
At the start of each night, you roll three dice that shape your experience:
- **Energy ⚡️:** How many customers you can serve  
- **Charm 🪄: ** How many points you earn per successful order  
- **Intuition 🔮:** How clear or vague customer moods will be  
These stats reset every night, so stay alert.

### Dialogue Clues 🔍
Each customer speaks in one of three tiers based on your Intuition:
- 🔷 **Low Intuition** → vague, hard to interpret  
- 🔷 **Medium Intuition** → subtle emotional hints  
- 🔷 **High Intuition** → emotionally revealing and specific  
Understanding their emotional state is your key to survival.

### Ingredient Mixing Station ☕️ 
- Click ingredients from the list on the left to add up to 4 slots  
- Watch the center mixing slot for the resulting drink  
- Click **Serve** to submit, or **Clear** to try again  

### Drink Types & Mood Matching 👤
- **Sad** → Moonflower Veil
- **Happy** → Sunshine Shot
- **Angry** → Ash & Thorns
- **Fearful** Floral Garden
- **Surprised** → Midnight Ember
- **Disgusted**	→ Bitter Comfort
Choose wisely. Matching mood to drink is your primary goal.

### Your Objective 🎯 
- Survive all **7 nights** 🕐  
- Customers appear one by one, you get limited chances per night 🧍‍♂️
- Serve, fail, or soothe. Each choice shifts the café’s atmosphere  🍵
Get it right, and you earn points.  
Get it wrong, and your night darkens.

## Developer's note 🖋️
For my first full project, I wanted to challenge myself not just technically, but creatively and conceptually.**Night Seven** is more than a game. It was my attempt to challenge my logical and functional side by structuring systems and mechanics, My styling and artistic eye by crafting immersive visuals and implementing an aesthetic as well as my visionary nature through committing fully to an idea and bringing it to life. I built this entire experience in just one week. Every pixel, line of code, and story element was driven by the desire to make something meaningful. I look forward to contributing to other projects, building more games, telling more stories, and leaving a mark through the experiences I create.

Thank you for playing!
