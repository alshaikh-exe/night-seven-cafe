# ☕ Night Seven 
A pixel-art browser game built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## 🎮 Description
You are the barista of a quiet café that only opens at night. Each customer enters with an unspoken mood such as joy, sadness or fear. It's your job to mix the right ingredients into a drink that matches their emotional state.

Each night begins with a roll of 3 dice:
- ⚡️ Energy: how many customers you can serve
- 🪄 Charm: how many points you earn per successful order
- 🔮 Intuition: how clear or vague customer moods are
  
Beware, for on certain nights, the ghosts that arrive aren't here for drinks... they're here for answers. And they all remember what you did.

Survive seven nights, serve your customers and uncover the truth behind it all on night seven!
